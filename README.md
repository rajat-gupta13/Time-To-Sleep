## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
* Unity 3D 5.3.4

### Rules of the Game

A set of rules and a basic description of what the game offers.

* The game is an infinite runner style game where you play the frog and use the trigger button to jump forward. 
* The player has to cross the lanes of traffic and get as far as possible while being chased by a wall of fire.


## What I learnt while building this game

I learnt how to procedurally generate terrain and generate cars when the player approaces a particualr lane.

I learnt how make the fire object move and appear big from my perspective but keep it significantly small otherwise.

I learnt how to use the Canvas object for making a simple UI in VR to move in and out of the game.

I learnt how to use the button as input to the game to control and move.
